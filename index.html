  <p>About me</p>
  <p>I have been writing important papers about me all my life. In middle school, I wrote an essay about how my mother's cancer affected me. 
  In High School, I wrote a treatise about how I wanted to design bionic eyes for the blind. My first year of college, 
  I wrote an sermon about Pascal's Wager. My second year of college, I wrote a memorandum on the reformation of the American Prison-Industrial Complex.
  In the end, I am a Naperville dishwasher who loves to write.</p>
